camelCase is correct 

"increment" i = i + 1;  > i++ , "decrement" i--;

The "remainder" operator % gives the remainder of the division of two numbers.

In mathematics, a number can be checked even or odd by checking the remainder of the division of the number by2. 
17 % 2 = 1 (17 is Odd)  -  48 % 2 = 0 (48 is Even)

+= handles compound assignment
