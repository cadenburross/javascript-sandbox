var defines the variable

camelCase is correct 

"increment" i = i + 1;  > i++ , "decrement" i--;

The "remainder" operator % gives the remainder of the division of two numbers.

In mathematics, a number can be checked even or odd by checking the remainder of the division of the number by2. 
17 % 2 = 1 (17 is Odd)  -  48 % 2 = 0 (48 is Even)

+= handles compound assignment 


/* This Converts Celsius to Fahrenheit */

function convert(celsius) {
  // Only change code below this line
var fahrenheit = 32 + 9/5 * celsius;   

  // Only change code above this line
  if ( typeof fahrenheit !== 'undefined' ) {
    return fahrenheit;
  } else {
    return 'fahrenheit not defined';
  }
}

convert(30);


To escape quotes, use \infront of the quote
Quotes are not the only characters that can be escaped inside a string. Here is a table of common escape sequences:

Code	Output
\'	single quote
\"	double quote
\\	backslash
\n	new line
\r	carriage return
\t	tab
\b	backspace
\f	form feed
Note that the backslash itself must be escaped in order to display as a backslash.

add strings using + or add lines of strings using +=


return a string's character length using .length
